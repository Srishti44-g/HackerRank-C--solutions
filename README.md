 **C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language**.
 
#### C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.

## It can be defined by the following ways:

-  **Mother language**
- **System programming language**
- **Procedure-oriented programming language**
- **Structured programming language**
- **Mid-level programming language**

#### In c, we can divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as function. The function contains the set of programming statements enclosed by {}. A function can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to the C program. In other words, we can say that the collection of functions creates a program. The function is also known as procedureor subroutinein other programming languages.

## Fan Fact of C
**C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.**

**C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.**

**The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).**

**The UNIX OS was totally written in C.**

**Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.**

**Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C**
